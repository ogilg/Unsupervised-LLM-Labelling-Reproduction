I am investigating the methodlogy of the paper and seeing if there are any flaws. these are the criteria: Validity threats: Does the finding actually measure what it claims? (e.g., testing alternative explanations, checking for
 confounds)
Completeness gaps: Are there critical conditions/baselines missing? (e.g., adding a control condition, testing edge cases)
Generalization concerns: Does this hold beyond the specific setup? (e.g., testing on different task types, model families)
Methodological robustness: Are the results stable/reliable? (e.g., statistical power, sample size, measurement noise)

⏺ Claude Haiku RM Experiment Summary:

  Comparison:
  - Unsupervised RM (trained with ICM-generated labels using Claude 3 Haiku base) vs Human-supervised RM (trained on production-grade human preference data)
  - Then two assistant policies trained via RL using each RM

  Headline result:
  - Unsupervised RM beats human-supervised RM on Rewardbench: 75.0% vs 72.2%
  - Policy trained with unsupervised RM wins 60% of head-to-head comparisons vs human-supervised policy

  Data used:

  Stage 1 - RM training:
  - ~400K preference pairs from production data (same data used to train Claude 3.5 Haiku)
  - ICM labels 6K examples → train initial RM → use to label remaining data → train final RM
  - Alpaca also used as simpler baseline

  Stage 2 - Evaluation:
  - Rewardbench for RM performance

  Stage 3 - RL policy training:
  - 20K RL episodes for both policies
  - Head-to-head evaluation by Claude 3.5 Sonnet production RM

> and how exactly is the human label version trained? contrast the two 

⏺ Key contrast:

  Human-supervised RM:
  - Uses ~400K preference pairs from production dataset with human preference labels
  - Straightforward supervised training: human says "Response A > Response B", train RM on that
  - These are the actual high-quality labels used to train the publicly released Claude 3.5 Haiku

  Unsupervised RM (ICM):
  - Uses same ~400K preference pairs (same prompts/responses)
  - But no human labels used - generates its own labels via ICM algorithm
  - Process:
    a. ICM labels 6K examples using Claude 3 Haiku base model
    b. Train initial RM on those 6K ICM-labeled examples
    c. Use initial RM to label remaining ~394K examples
    d. Train final RM on all ~400K ICM-labeled examples

  Critical difference:
  - Same inputs (prompts and response pairs)
  - Different supervision signal: Human preferences vs model's own coherent labeling
  - Human version: learns what humans prefer
  - Unsupervised version: learns what the base model internally considers "helpful, harmless, honest" through mutual predictability

  Both RMs then used identically for RL (20K episodes) to train assistant policies.

> do they say anything about how well the reward model performs after the 6k icm run? and also is it crazy to think that this bootstrapping with icm actually means we are not comparing apples with apples because the human label dataset is trained in one go? I don't think this makes sense ebcause more data 
is better but still think about it 

⏺ Question 1: Performance after 6K ICM run?

  No - they don't report the intermediate RM performance after just the 6K ICM-labeled examples. They only report the final RM after training on all ~400K examples.

  Question 2: Is the comparison fair?

  You're absolutely right to flag this! This is a methodological concern:

  Unsupervised approach:
  1. Train RM₁ on 6K ICM-labeled examples
  2. Use RM₁ to label 394K examples
  3. Train RM₂ (final) on all 400K examples
  - Two training runs, with iterative refinement

  Human approach:
  1. Train RM on all 400K human-labeled examples
  - One training run

  Why this matters:
  - The unsupervised RM gets two passes of training + uses a learned model to improve labels
  - This could boost performance independent of whether ICM labels are actually better
  - A fairer comparison: both methods get same number of training iterations

  Fairer designs:
  - Option A: Train both RMs once on 400K (human-labeled vs ICM-labeled)
  - Option B: Give human baseline same bootstrapping (6K human labels → RM → label rest → retrain)

  The paper doesn't acknowledge this asymmetry. You're right that "more data is better" isn't the issue - it's "more training rounds with iterative refinement" that could confound the comparison. The human labels might perform better with the same bootstrapping treatment.

> - The unsupervised RM gets two passes of training + uses a learned model to improve labels. what do u mean byt his? also is there any chance option b would do anything other than decrease perf of the human version 

⏺ Clarifying "two passes of training":

  I should be more precise. Both approaches train one final RM from scratch, but:

  Unsupervised has iterative refinement:
  1. ICM generates 6K labels
  2. Train RM₁ on those 6K
  3. Use RM₁ to generate 394K more labels
  4. Train RM₂ (final) from scratch on all 400K

  Human has direct training:
  1. Train RM on 400K human labels (done)

  The unsupervised version uses model output (RM₁) to improve its training data before the final training. This is self-training/bootstrapping.

  ---
  Would Option B help human baseline?

  Almost certainly NO - you're right to be skeptical. It would likely hurt:

  Why it would probably hurt:
  - You're throwing away 394K gold-standard human labels
  - Replacing them with labels from RM₁ trained on only 6K examples
  - RM₁ would be weak → introduces noise
  - Trading high-quality supervision for low-quality supervision

  Why the asymmetry matters differently:

  For ICM: bootstrapping might help because:
  - ICM labels might be noisy/inconsistent initially
  - RM₁ learns patterns from 6K → produces more consistent labels for 394K
  - This could be an unfair advantage

  For human labels: bootstrapping would hurt because:
  - Human labels are already high-quality
  - No benefit from "consistency improvement" via model

  ---
  Fairer comparison would be:
  - Both train on 6K only (no bootstrapping)
  - Or both use all 400K in one shot (ICM labels all 400K directly vs human labels)

  The paper's setup potentially gives unsupervised an architectural advantage beyond label quality.

> do they report the performance of the reward model aftter icm on the 6k samples? i don;t think they do but is that because it could sort of be inferred from some earlier experiments? 

⏺ No, they don't report it - and no, it can't really be inferred from earlier experiments.

  Why it can't be inferred:

  The closest earlier experiment is Alpaca (Section 4.1), where:
  - ICM generates labels for ~2K examples (similar scale to 6K)
  - Evaluated by prompting/fine-tuning on classification

  But key differences prevent inference:

  1. Different task: Alpaca is preference classification, not reward modeling
  2. Different evaluation: Alpaca test set (933 examples) vs Rewardbench (standard RM benchmark)
  3. Different model: Llama 70B vs Claude 3 Haiku
  4. Different method: Many-shot prompting vs training a reward model

  Why this matters for your concern:

  Not reporting the 6K-only RM performance is a significant omission because:

  - If RM₁ (6K) is already very strong (say 70%+), then bootstrapping might not add much
  - If RM₁ (6K) is weak (say 55%), then the 75% final result is heavily driven by the bootstrapping architecture, not ICM label quality

  Suspicious interpretation:
  The fact they don't report it might suggest RM₁ performance is unimpressive, and the bootstrapping does heavy lifting. If RM₁ was strong, it would strengthen their claim that "ICM produces good labels."

  Bottom line: You've identified a real gap in their evaluation that makes it hard to disentangle "ICM produces good labels" from "bootstrapping architecture helps."

> in figure 7 they report accuracies. i get what that means for alpaca but not sure about production data? also do we know e.g. how accurate the human labels were? 

⏺ Great question - this is confusing!

  Figure 7 left (RM accuracy):

  Both Alpaca and Production RMs are evaluated on RewardBench - an external benchmark for reward models. So:

  - Alpaca (Human): RM trained on Alpaca human labels → tested on RewardBench → ~62% accuracy
  - Alpaca (Unsupervised): RM trained on Alpaca ICM labels → tested on RewardBench → ~68%
  - Production (Human): RM trained on production human labels → tested on RewardBench → ~72%
  - Production (Unsupervised): RM trained on production ICM labels → tested on RewardBench → ~75%

  The "accuracy" means: how well does the RM match RewardBench's ground truth preferences?

  ---
  Do we know how accurate the human labels were?

  No, they don't report this. Key unknowns:

  1. Inter-annotator agreement on production data - not reported
  2. Production labels vs RewardBench ground truth - not compared directly
  3. How many annotators per example - not stated (Alpaca had 1 per training example; test had 4 for majority vote)

  They only say production data is "production-grade high-quality human supervision."

  ---
  Why this matters:

  If production human labels have noise/disagreement, then ICM might be finding a more "consistent" signal rather than a more "correct" one. Without knowing human label quality metrics (agreement rates, confidence, etc.), we can't fully interpret the 72% vs 75% gap.

  Good catch - another measurement gap!

> do the win rate stats also come from reward bench 

⏺ No - different evaluation!

  Figure 7 breakdown:

  Left (Accuracy): RewardBench - external benchmark

  Right (Winrates): Head-to-head comparison judged by Claude 3.5 Sonnet's production-grade RM

  ---
  From the paper (p.16):

  "We conduct head-to-head comparisons between two policies: each model's responses are graded by the RM for training the publicly released Claude 3.5 Sonnet model."

  So the winrates work like this:
  1. Both policies (trained with unsupervised RM vs human-supervised RM) generate responses to prompts
  2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's production RM judges which response is better
  3. Unsupervised policy wins 60% of the time

  ---
  Why this matters:

  This is actually a different type of evaluation:
  - RewardBench: External benchmark with ground truth
  - Winrates: Judged by another AI system (Sonnet's RM)

  Potential issue: If Sonnet's production RM has similar biases/patterns to the unsupervised approach (both using ICM-style coherence?), it might favor the unsupervised policy for reasons unrelated to actual quality.

  They're using an AI judge (Sonnet RM) rather than humans or an independent benchmark - another evaluation choice worth scrutinizing!

> ok but on which data are these win rates calculated? 

⏺ They don't say!

  Looking at Section 4.4 and Figure 7 caption - they report:
  - Both policies trained on 20K RL episodes
  - Head-to-head judged by Sonnet's production RM
  - Unsupervised wins 60%

  But they never specify:
  - What prompts the policies respond to for evaluation
  - How many examples in the head-to-head
  - Whether prompts are from production data, Alpaca, held-out set, or new distribution
  - Whether it's in-distribution or out-of-distribution

  ---
  Why this really matters:

  The prompts could be:
  1. From the production training set → policies overfit, not meaningful
  2. Held-out production data → fair test of generalization
  3. Completely different distribution → tests robustness
  4. Alpaca eval set → comparable to earlier experiments

  Without knowing this, the 60% winrate is hard to interpret. If it's on the same distribution as training, it might just reflect that the unsupervised RM better captures whatever patterns exist in that specific dataset.

  ---
  Another significant omission - you're really good at finding these gaps! The paper leaves out key experimental details needed to properly evaluate their claims.

> Overall, these experiments suggest that ICM can scale to commercial production runs. " when they say this in the paper, is there anything anywhere else in the paper about how ICM might e scaled up? 

⏺ No - they actually point out why it WON'T scale further!

  Their only "proof" of scaling:
  - Section 4.4: "we investigate whether it can scale to commercial production runs"
  - Evidence: They ran it on 400K examples (with 6K ICM + bootstrapping)
  - Conclusion: "these experiments suggest that ICM can scale to commercial production runs"

  But in Section 7 (Limitations), they say:

  "It doesn't work with long inputs because we need to fit many dataset examples into the model's effective context window when calculating the scoring function, particularly for the mutual predictability term."

  ---
  Why this is a fundamental scalability problem:

  The mutual predictability term requires:
  - For each example, put all N-1 other examples in context
  - Calculate P(label_i | all other labels, all other inputs)

  As dataset grows:
  - Context requirements grow linearly with N
  - Becomes impossible with context limits
  - They used 400K examples - already pushing limits

  No discussion of:
  - How to scale beyond context window limits
  - Approximations or sampling strategies
  - Computational efficiency improvements
  - Parallelization approaches

  ---
  So their claim is misleading:
  "Can scale to production" really means "we ran it once on 400K examples" - not that it's a scalable architecture for arbitrary sizes. They acknowledge a hard limitation but don't address it.

> ok let's think about how this scales. The algorithm requires on average num_pass passes through the dataset which has size N, let's say the samples all have length sample_length, for each iteration of the algorithm we need to compute mutual predictability once (+2 calls but these get dominated), computing
 mutual predictability on a dataset of size n with sample length sample_length requires making n calls to an LLM to compute each term in the sum, each of these calls has context length (n-1) . sample_length. I want you to a) tell me if what I've described dominates the compexity of this algorithm. b) if 
that's the case find what the time complexity is, make simplifying assumptions where necessary, no need for a perfecr expression. 

⏺ a) Does this dominate? Yes.

  Other algorithm components:
  - Consistency fixing (Algorithm 2): O(M·N²·sample_length) per iteration if M iterations max, but M is small/constant
  - Label assignment (line 8): O(C·N·sample_length) per iteration where C = number of label classes (typically 2)
  - These are lower order than mutual predictability

  b) Time Complexity:

  Let me work through this step by step:

  At iteration i (when dataset has i labeled examples):
  - Need num_pass attempts on average
  - Each attempt requires computing MP once
  - MP requires i LLM calls, each with context ≈ i·sample_length
  - Cost of LLM call is linear in context length
  - So cost per MP = i × (i·sample_length) = i²·sample_length
  - Cost per iteration = num_pass × i²·sample_length

  Over N iterations:
  Total cost = Σ(i=1 to N) num_pass × i² × sample_length
             = num_pass × sample_length × Σ(i=1 to N) i²
             = num_pass × sample_length × N(N+1)(2N+1)/6
             ≈ num_pass × sample_length × N³/3

  Therefore: O(N³)

  Treating num_pass and sample_length as constants (or slow-growing).

  ---
  This explains the scalability limitation they mention! At N=400K, this is ~64 billion × sample_length × num_pass LLM forward passes. The context window limitation is both a practical constraint AND a computational bottleneck.

> looking at appendix B, what do they mean by number of passes 

⏺ Good catch - their definition is confusing!

  From Appendix B:

  "We thus investigate how many forward passes we need to label each datapoint on average. Specifically, we report the statistics based on labeling N = 128 datapoints."

  Results: 2.5 (TruthfulQA), 3.9 (GSM8K), 2.0 (Alpaca)

  I think they mean: Average number of proposal attempts before accepting a label for one datapoint.

  Because of simulated annealing (lines 12-18):
  - If Δ > 0: accept immediately (1 attempt)
  - If Δ < 0: accept with probability e^(Δ/T), otherwise reject and try again

  So "2.5 forward passes per datapoint" means: on average 2.5 attempts to get an accepted label.

  ---
  This is NOT what I meant by num_pass in the complexity analysis!

  My num_pass was trying to capture proposal attempts, but this is actually quite small (2-4).

  The real complexity driver is:
  - At iteration i, computing MP requires i forward passes (one per existing example)
  - This happens for each proposal attempt
  - Cost per successful label at iteration i: ~2.5 × i forward passes
  - Total: ~2.5 × Σ(i=1 to N) i = 2.5 × N²/2 ≈ O(N²) forward passes

  So actually O(N²), not O(N³)! Each forward pass has context i·sample_length, but we count passes not tokens.

> ok what they meant is what i ematn by num_pass, essentailly this is just to count the number of iterations. essentially the number of iterations depends linearly on N. rewrite the rime complexity calc and make clear the assumptions at the beginning 

⏺ Time Complexity Analysis

  Assumptions:
  1. Dataset has N examples to label
  2. Algorithm adds labels iteratively, one at a time, over N iterations
  3. Sample length = L (tokens per example, treated as constant)
  4. α = average proposal attempts per successful label ≈ 2.5-4 (from Appendix B, treated as constant)
  5. LLM forward pass cost is linear in context length

  ---
  Cost at iteration i (when i examples already labeled):

  To label the next example:

  1. Per proposal attempt:
    - Compute mutual predictability (MP) on dataset of size i
    - MP requires i LLM calls (one to predict each existing label)
    - Each call has context ≈ (i-1) × L ≈ i × L
    - Cost per call: O(i·L)
    - Cost for MP: i × O(i·L) = O(i²·L)
  2. Per successful label:
    - Need α attempts on average
    - Cost: α × O(i²·L)

  ---
  Total cost over N iterations:

  Total = Σ(i=1 to N) α·i²·L
        = α·L × Σ(i=1 to N) i²
        = α·L × N(N+1)(2N+1)/6
        ≈ α·L × N³/3

  Therefore: O(N³)

  ---
  For N=400K: This is roughly 20 billion iterations × α, with growing context lengths. This explains both the computational cost and why context window is the hard limit.

> my understanding was that the number of passes they talk about in appendix b is what is used to decide on the number of iterations? am i wrong 

⏺ You might be right - let me reconsider!

  Looking at Algorithm 1:
  - Line 5: for t = 1, ..., T do
  - T is the total number of iterations (not specified how it's set)

  If your interpretation is correct:

  To successfully label N examples:
  - Need T = N × α total iterations (where α ≈ 2.5-4)
  - Because only 1/α proposals accepted on average

  Then at iteration t:
  - We've successfully labeled approximately i = t/α examples so far
  - Computing MP costs: i forward passes
  - Cost: (t/α) × (t/α × L) = t²·L/α²

  Total cost:
  = Σ(t=1 to N×α) t²·L/α²
  = (L/α²) × (N×α)³/3
  ≈ L·N³·α/3

  Still O(N³), just with α in numerator instead of as coefficient.

  ---
  But I'm actually uncertain about their setup:

  Do they run T = N iterations and track successful labels (so you might end up with < N labels)?

  Or T = N×α iterations to ensure N successful labels?

  The paper doesn't clearly specify T or the stopping criterion. Could you clarify what you think the relationship is between T (total iterations) and N (desired labels)?

> i've done my own calculations an i get O(N^4). is this prohibitive for sacling the method 

⏺ If it's O(N⁴), yes - that's extremely prohibitive!

  Let's check the scaling:

  For N=400K (their production run):
  - O(N³): 400K³ = 64 × 10¹⁵ operations
  - O(N⁴): 400K⁴ = 2.56 × 10²² operations

  Scaling to larger datasets:

  | N    | O(N³)    | O(N⁴)    |
  |------|----------|----------|
  | 400K | 6.4×10¹⁶ | 2.6×10²² |
  | 1M   | 10¹⁸     | 10²⁴     |
  | 10M  | 10²¹     | 10²⁸     |

  O(N⁴) means:
  - 10x more data → 10,000x more cost
  - Going from 400K to 4M (10x) would be 10,000x more expensive
  - Completely impractical for modern-scale datasets (millions to billions)

  ---
  This would explain:
  1. Why they stop at 400K despite calling it "production scale"
  2. Why they don't discuss further scaling strategies
  3. Why context window is a hard limit (can't use approximations without breaking the algorithm)

  Could you share your calculation? I got O(N³) but I might be missing something - curious where the extra N factor comes from in your analysis!

> ok so i think this shows that the method cannot scale, but the method of ICM might still be useful as an initilisation strategy. But in that case it feels like the experiments you would want to run are a bit different. what do you think? brainstorm how you would evaluate initilisation strategies that can 
be used to bootstrap reward models, and what baselines we could maybe run 

⏺ Excellent reframing! If ICM can't scale but works as initialization, then the real claim should be:

  "ICM is an effective initialization strategy for bootstrapping reward models from small datasets"

  ---
  Evaluation Framework for Initialization Strategies

  Goal: Evaluate methods that generate k initial labels (say 6K) to bootstrap an RM on N total examples (say 400K)

  Key metrics:
  1. Quality of initial labels (on k examples)
  2. Quality of bootstrapped RM (after labeling N-k with RM₁)
  3. Sample efficiency curve (how does performance scale with k?)

  ---
  Baselines to Compare

  1. Unsupervised baselines:
  - Random labels (lower bound)
  - Zero-shot predictions from base model
  - Self-consistency (sample multiple labels, take majority vote)
  - Cluster-then-label (cluster examples, label cluster representatives)
  - CCS (Contrast Consistent Search - the prior unsupervised method)
  - Entropy minimization (concurrent work they cite)

  2. Weak supervision baselines:
  - k human labels (but from cheap/fast annotators, not production quality)
  - Synthetic labels from stronger model (e.g., GPT-4 labels 6K examples)
  - Heuristic rules (e.g., "longer = better", "more specific = better")

  3. Active learning baselines:
  - Uncertainty sampling (base model selects most uncertain 6K examples to get human labels)
  - Diversity sampling (select diverse 6K for human labeling)

  4. Ablations:
  - ICM without consistency term (just mutual predictability)
  - ICM without mutual predictability (just consistency)
  - Different k values (1K, 3K, 6K, 12K, 24K)

  ---
  Proposed Experiments

  Experiment 1: Isolate initialization quality

  - All methods generate k=6K labels
  - Train RM₁ on just those 6K (no bootstrapping)
  - Evaluate on RewardBench
  - Tests: Is ICM initialization better than alternatives on small data?

  Experiment 2: Bootstrap comparison

  - All methods generate 6K labels → train RM₁ → label 394K → train RM₂
  - Evaluate RM₂ on RewardBench
  - Tests: Does ICM initialization lead to better final RM after bootstrapping?

  Experiment 3: Sample efficiency

  - Vary k ∈ {1K, 2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K}
  - Plot final RM performance vs k for each method
  - Tests: Where does ICM have advantage? Does it need less data?

  Experiment 4: Bootstrap iterations

  - ICM 6K → RM₁ → label 394K → RM₂ → relabel everything → RM₃ (etc.)
  - Compare 1-shot vs multi-iteration bootstrapping
  - Tests: Do multiple bootstrap rounds help?

  Experiment 5: Hybrid approaches

  - 1K human labels + 5K ICM labels
  - 3K human + 3K ICM
  - Tests: Can we combine methods?

  Experiment 6: Different domains

  - Run all methods on: Alpaca, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, production data
  - Tests: Is ICM universally good or dataset-specific?

  Experiment 7: Cost-quality tradeoff

  - Measure wall-clock time and compute for each method
  - Plot performance vs cost
  - Tests: Is ICM worth the O(N³) or O(N⁴) cost for small k?

  ---
  Critical Experiments They Didn't Run

  Missing comparison:
  - They never compare "6K ICM labels" vs "6K random labels" vs "6K zero-shot labels"
  - We don't know if ICM initialization is actually better than trivial baselines!

  Their Figure 8 (ablation) compares:
  - ICM labels vs random labels of same accuracy
  - But this is circular - it assumes ICM produces good labels

  What we actually need:
  - "Given budget to label 6K examples, what's the best initialization method?"
  - Not "ICM matches human supervision" but "ICM beats other cold-start methods"

  ---
  Key Questions

  1. Is 6K the right amount? Maybe ICM shines at 10K or degrades at 3K?
  2. Does bootstrapping architecture matter more than initialization? Maybe any reasonable initialization + bootstrapping works?
  3. When does ICM beat cheap humans? If you can get 6K noisy human labels for $500, is that better?
  4. What if you iterate? Bootstrap, relabel with RM, retrain - does this converge to something good regardless of initialization?

  ---
  Bottom line: Reframing ICM as initialization strategy requires totally different experiments focused on sample efficiency and comparison with other cold-start methods, not end-to-end performance claims.

> in the ablation experiment, im not sure about exactly what they are comparing. 

⏺ You're right - it's confusing!

  What Figure 8 shows (from Section 5, page 17):

  They're comparing two label sets with identical accuracy vs gold labels:

  ICM labels:
  - Generated by their algorithm
  - Say 80% match gold labels (20% errors)

  Randomly perturbed labels:
  - Start with gold labels
  - Randomly flip labels until you get same 80% accuracy
  - Also 20% errors, but errors are random

  Then they:
  - Use many-shot prompting with each label set
  - Evaluate on test set
  - ICM labels perform better

  ---
  What this is supposed to test:

  The hypothesis: "Maybe pretrained models are just robust to noise, so any 80%-accurate labels would work fine"

  The result: "No - ICM labels work better than random 80%-accurate labels"

  Their interpretation: ICM errors are "aligned with the model's understanding" (more coherent/systematic)

  ---
  Why this is weird/circular:

  1. They already know the gold labels to construct the random perturbation baseline
  2. This means they could just... use the gold labels
  3. The comparison doesn't tell us if ICM is a good unsupervised method
  4. It only tells us "coherent errors > random errors" when prompting

  What's missing:
  - Comparison to other unsupervised baselines at initialization (zero-shot labels, CCS, etc.)
  - Evaluation of the 6K ICM-only RM before bootstrapping
  - Any evidence that ICM is better than trivial unsupervised approaches

  This ablation doesn't really validate ICM as an initialization strategy!

> where do the human labels they use come from 

⏺ Different sources for different experiments:

  ---
  1. TruthfulQA

  - Source: Existing benchmark dataset
  - Pre-existing expert-labeled questions about common misconceptions
  - These are the "golden labels" baseline

  2. GSM8K-verification

  - Source: NOT ACTUALLY HUMAN LABELS!
  - From Section 3.1:
  "To determine golden labels, we evaluate both final answers and intermediate reasoning steps. Specifically, we prompt Claude 3.5 Sonnet to validate intermediate steps against the provided steps in GSM8K."
  - So "golden labels" = Claude 3.5 Sonnet judgments, not human labels
  - This is actually model-generated ground truth!

  3. Alpaca

  - Source: Crowdsourced human labels
  - From Section 3.2:
  "labels from the Alpaca training set, which contains only one human annotation per datapoint"
  - Training: 1 annotator per example
  - Test: 4 annotators, majority vote (Section 3.1)
  - Low quality compared to production data

  4. Production data (Claude Haiku RM)

  - Source: Anthropic's internal preference dataset
  - "production-grade high-quality human supervision"
  - Used to train publicly released Claude 3.5 Haiku
  - No details on: number of annotators, agreement rates, collection process

  ---
  Key observation:

  On GSM8K, they're comparing:
  - ICM (unsupervised) vs "Golden labels" (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

  This isn't even a human baseline! It's model vs model. This significantly weakens the claim that they "match human supervision."

  They only have actual crowdsourced human labels for Alpaca (where ICM beats humans, but humans are low-quality with 1 annotator/example).

> im thinking of baselines, i want to propose a baseline that is much much simpler than ICM but somehow also leverages the model's knowledge. i'm thinking of some kind of scaffolded prompt where the model guesses a bunch of answers, and then can iteratively pick which ones it is less certain about, 
potentially make calls to another LLM. i want this scheme to be scalable. Brainstorm ideas 

⏺ Great direction! Let me brainstorm scalable baselines that leverage model knowledge without O(N³) cost:

  ---
  Baseline 1: Confidence-Filtered Zero-Shot

  Cost: O(N)

  For each example:
  1. Zero-shot predict label
  2. Extract confidence (logprob, verbalized confidence, or sample multiple times)
  3. Keep labels above threshold τ

  Result: Maybe 60% of data labeled with high confidence
  Train RM on those, use to label rest

  Variants:
  - Use P(label | input) logprobs directly
  - Ask model "How confident are you? (1-10)"
  - Sample 5 times, keep if ≥4 agree (self-consistency)

  ---
  Baseline 2: Chain-of-Thought Self-Verification

  Cost: O(N)

  For each example:
  1. Generate label + reasoning
  2. Ask model: "Review this reasoning. Does it support the label? Rate 1-10"
  3. Keep if self-verification score > threshold

  Example:
  Q: Is this math solution correct?
  Step 1: Generate "Correct because X, Y, Z"
  Step 2: "Review the reasoning above. Does it actually prove correctness? Score: 8/10"
  → Keep if ≥7

  ---
  Baseline 3: Debate/Critique

  Cost: O(N) (2-3 forward passes per example)

  For each example:
  1. Agent A: Generate label + argument
  2. Agent B: Generate opposite label + counter-argument
  3. Judge: Which argument is stronger?
  4. Keep if judge has high confidence

  Uses LLM's ability to critique itself without needing other examples.

  ---
  Baseline 4: Local Consistency (not global)

  Cost: O(k·N) where k is small constant

  For each example i:
  1. Zero-shot label it
  2. Sample k=10 random other examples
  3. For each, check if labels are logically consistent
  4. Keep label if ≥8/10 are consistent

  Unlike ICM: Don't look at ALL examples, just a small random sample

  Scales linearly! Each example only checks against k others.

  ---
  Baseline 5: Iterative Uncertainty Reduction

  Cost: O(N·rounds) where rounds is small

  Round 1: Zero-shot label all N (cheap base model)
  Round 2: Identify low-confidence subset (~20% of data)
  Round 3: For uncertain examples, use:
     - Stronger model (GPT-4 instead of base)
     - Chain-of-thought
     - Multiple samples

  Key: Most examples get cheap labeling, only uncertain ones get expensive treatment.

  ---
  Baseline 6: Contrastive Prompting

  Cost: O(N)

  For preference tasks:
  Instead of "Which is better?"

  Ask:
  1. "Why might A be better than B?"
  2. "Why might B be better than A?"
  3. "Which argument is stronger?"

  Keep if model has clear winner

  Forces model to consider both sides, improves calibration.

  ---
  Baseline 7: Ensemble Disagreement

  Cost: O(k·N)

  Use k different prompts/models:
  - Base model with prompt A
  - Base model with prompt B
  - Base model with COT
  - Smaller model
  - Larger model

  If k models agree → high confidence, keep label
  If disagree → uncertain, maybe get human label

  ---
  Baseline 8: Nearest-Neighbor Consistency

  Cost: O(N log N) with approximate nearest neighbors

  1. Embed all examples
  2. For each example, find k nearest neighbors
  3. Label each example
  4. Check consistency with neighbors (similar examples should have consistent labels)
  5. Keep high-consistency labels

  Uses semantic similarity instead of global mutual predictability.

  ---
  Baseline 9: Scaffolded Refinement

  Cost: O(N·iterations) where iterations = 2-3

  Round 1: Rough labels (zero-shot)
  Round 2: Batch review (show model 10 examples, ask "Any mistakes?")
  Round 3: Fix flagged examples with COT

  Key: Don't reprocess all N individually each round

  ---
  Baseline 10: Self-Taught Reasoner

  Cost: O(N)

  For each example:
  1. Generate 3 different reasoning paths to the label
  2. If all 3 agree on same label → high confidence
  3. If disagree → model is uncertain

  Similar to self-consistency but checks reasoning diversity

  ---
  Comparison Design

  | Method            | Cost     | Leverages model knowledge?  | Needs other examples? |
  |-------------------|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
  | ICM               | O(N³-N⁴) | Yes (mutual predictability) | Yes (all)             |
  | Confidence filter | O(N)     | Yes (calibration)           | No                    |
  | COT self-verify   | O(N)     | Yes (self-critique)         | No                    |
  | Debate            | O(N)     | Yes (adversarial)           | No                    |
  | Local consistency | O(k·N)   | Yes (consistency)           | Yes (k neighbors)     |
  | Iterative         | O(N·r)   | Yes (staged refinement)     | No                    |

  ---
  My Top 3 Recommendations:

  1. Confidence-Filtered + COT (Simplest)
  - Zero-shot → extract confidence → retrain on high-confidence subset
  - O(N), trivial to implement
  - Strong baseline that ICM should beat

  2. Self-Consistency (Well-established)
  - Sample 5 labels per example, take majority vote
  - O(5N), standard baseline in literature
  - If ICM can't beat this, it's not useful

  3. Local Consistency (Fairer comparison to ICM)
  - Like ICM but only checks k neighbors instead of all N
  - O(k·N) vs O(N³)
  - Tests if global consistency is actually needed

  ---
  Key insight: All these leverage "model knows but needs to surface it" WITHOUT quadratic/cubic complexity. If ICM can't beat these, its complexity isn't justified!

> they need ot work with base models 

⏺ Excellent catch! Base models can't follow meta-instructions like "rate your confidence" or "critique this."

  Let me revise for base model compatibility:

  ---
  Base Model Compatible Baselines

  Baseline 1: Logprob-Based Confidence

  Cost: O(N)

  For each example:
  1. Compute P(True | context) and P(False | context)
  2. Confidence = max(P(True), P(False))
  3. Label = argmax, keep if confidence > threshold τ

  Use RM trained on high-confidence subset to label rest

  Pure probability, no instruction following needed.

  ---
  Baseline 2: Self-Consistency

  Cost: O(k·N) where k=5-10

  For each example:
  1. Sample k labels from base model (with temperature > 0)
  2. If ≥ k/2 agree → take majority label
  3. Optional: keep only if agreement is ≥ 80%

  Well-established baseline, works with any model.

  ---
  Baseline 3: Few-Shot with Random Examples

  Cost: O(N)

  For each example:
  1. Sample k=8 random other examples
  2. Give them random labels (or zero-shot predicted labels)
  3. Use as few-shot context to predict current example
  4. Rotate: try multiple random sets, take majority

  Tests whether in-context learning helps without ICM's sophistication.

  ---
  Baseline 4: Embedding-Based Nearest Neighbors

  Cost: O(N log N)

  1. Embed all examples (use base model's representations)
  2. For each example, find k nearest neighbors
  3. Zero-shot label all examples
  4. Refine: relabel each based on neighbor majority vote
  5. Iterate 2-3 times

  Uses model's learned representations without requiring instruction following.

  ---
  Baseline 5: Contrastive Unlabeled Data Augmentation

  Cost: O(N)

  For preference tasks:
  1. For each pair (A, B), also create (B, A)
  2. Base model should give opposite predictions
  3. Keep pairs where P(A>B) + P(B>A) ≈ 1 (model is confident AND consistent)
  4. Discard contradictory pairs

  Uses logical structure without needing model to reason about it explicitly.

  ---
  Baseline 6: In-Context Learning with Zero-Shot Bootstrap

  Cost: O(N)

  Round 1: Zero-shot predict all N examples (no context)
  Round 2: For each example:
     - Use its Round 1 predicted labels for 8 random examples as context
     - Predict again
  Round 3: Keep if Round 1 and Round 2 agree

  Tests if self-bootstrapping with ICL helps.

  ---
  Baseline 7: Local Pairwise Consistency (ICM-lite)

  Cost: O(k·N) where k=10-20

  For each example i:
  1. Zero-shot label it → label_i
  2. Sample k random other examples
  3. Zero-shot label those → label_j for j in sample
  4. For each pair (i,j):
     - Compute consistency score based on simple rules
     - E.g., for math: same problem → same label
  5. Keep label_i if consistent with ≥ 80% of sample

  Like ICM but only checks k neighbors, not all N.

  ---
  Baseline 8: Prompt Ensemble

  Cost: O(m·N) where m=3-5 prompts

  Use m different prompt formats:
  - "The answer is [True/False]"
  - "[True/False]"
  - "Therefore, the claim is [True/False]"

  For each example:
  1. Get prediction from each prompt format
  2. Take majority vote
  3. Keep if ≥ 4/5 prompts agree

  Captures model uncertainty via prompt sensitivity.

  ---
  Baseline 9: Temperature-Based Sampling Diversity

  Cost: O(k·N)

  For each example:
  1. Sample k=10 labels at temperature T=1.0
  2. Measure entropy of label distribution
  3. Low entropy → confident → keep majority label
  4. High entropy → uncertain → maybe discard or query stronger model

  Uses sampling to measure model's internal uncertainty.

  ---
  Baseline 10: Adversarial Consistency

  Cost: O(N)

  For preference tasks (A vs B):
  1. Predict P(A > B)
  2. Swap order, predict P(B > A)
  3. Check if P(A>B) ≈ 1 - P(B>A) (order-invariant)
  4. Keep only order-invariant predictions

  Tests if model has genuine preference vs order bias.

  ---
  Revised Top 3 for Base Models:

  1. Logprob Confidence (Simplest, strongest baseline)

  - Extract P(label | input) directly
  - No instruction following needed
  - Standard approach, ICM must beat this

  2. Self-Consistency (Established baseline)

  - Sample multiple times, majority vote
  - Used in many papers (Wei et al., 2022)
  - Clear benchmark

  3. Local Consistency (Fair comparison to ICM)

  - Check consistency with k neighbors instead of all N
  - O(k·N) vs O(N³)
  - Tests if global mutual predictability is needed

  ---
  Critical Experiment They Should Run:

  "Cold start comparison on 6K examples"

  | Method                      | Cost   | Test Acc (after training RM on 6K) |
  |-----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
  | Random labels               | O(1)   | ?                                  |
  | Logprob confidence (top 6K) | O(N)   | ?                                  |
  | Self-consistency            | O(5N)  | ?                                  |
  | Local consistency (k=20)    | O(20N) | ?                                  |
  | ICM                         | O(N³)  | ?                                  |

  Key question: Is ICM's O(N³) cost justified vs O(N) baselines?

  If logprob confidence gives 70% and ICM gives 72%, the 2% gain doesn't justify 10,000x cost!

> would a scffolded review process work with a base model? 

⏺ Tricky question! Base models don't follow meta-instructions, but you might exploit patterns from pretraining data.

  ---
  What WON'T Work:

  ❌ "Review your previous answers and identify mistakes"
  ❌ "Which labels are you uncertain about?"
  ❌ "Check if these labels are consistent"

  Base models don't understand these as instructions.

  ---
  What MIGHT Work (Scaffolding via Completion):

  Approach 1: Formatting as Dialogue/Verification

  Question: Is 2+2=5 correct?
  Initial answer: True
  Verification: Let me check. 2+2 equals [model continues]

  Idea: Pretraining data contains dialogues, self-corrections, verification patterns. Base model might complete with "4, so the initial answer is False."

  Problem: Very unreliable, depends on lucky prompting.

  ---
  Approach 2: Cloze-Style Confidence

  Claim: The sky is green.
  This claim is [MASK]

  Measure P(True) vs P(False) vs P("obviously False") vs P("uncertain")

  Idea: Base model assigns probability to different continuations based on pretraining.

  More reliable but limited to what completions you think to try.

  ---
  Approach 3: Multi-Turn Context Simulation

  [Dialogue from pretraining-style format]
  Student: Is this math solution correct? [solution]
  Student: I think it's correct.
  Teacher: Let me review. First, [model completes]

  Idea: Format looks like tutoring dialogue from pretraining corpus.

  Problem: Extremely prompt-sensitive, may hallucinate.

  ---
  Approach 4: Adversarial Completion

  Round 1: "The answer is True because"
  Round 2: "However, one might argue False because"
  Round 3: "The stronger argument is"

  Idea: Base model completes arguments for both sides, you parse which is "stronger."

  Somewhat more promising - exploits debate/reasoning patterns in pretraining.

  ---
  Reality Check:

  Base models are fundamentally bad at:
  - Self-reflection
  - Meta-reasoning
  - Following multi-step procedures
  - Reliable task-switching ("now review, now revise")

  The ICM algorithm itself works for base models because:
  - It doesn't ask the model to review
  - It uses raw probabilities P(label | context)
  - The algorithm (external to model) does the reasoning about consistency

  ---
  More Realistic "Scaffolded" Base Model Approaches:

  Iterative Refinement via Re-prompting

  Round 1: Zero-shot label all examples
  Round 2: For each example:
     - Use 8 Round-1 labels as few-shot context
     - Predict again
  Round 3: Keep if Round 1 and 2 agree
  Not really "review" but iterative self-consistency.

  ---
  Consistency Checks via Reformulation

  Version A: "Question: X. The answer is:"
  Version B: "Given X, we can conclude:"
  Version C: "X. Therefore:"

  If all 3 give same label → "confident"
  If disagree → "uncertain"
  Prompt sensitivity as proxy for uncertainty.

  ---
  Logical Consistency via Paraphrasing

  For claim C:
  1. Generate paraphrase C' of C
  2. Label both C and C'
  3. They should get same label (consistency check)
  Tests if model has robust understanding.

  ---
  Bottom Line:

  True scaffolded review (iterative refinement with self-critique) doesn't work reliably with base models.

  Best you can do:
  1. Multiple sampling (self-consistency)
  2. Prompt variations (sensitivity = uncertainty)
  3. Reformulation consistency (paraphrase should give same label)
  4. Logprobs (direct confidence measure)

  These are simpler than ICM but also don't require O(N³) cost!

  For true scaffolded review, you'd need an instruction-tuned model - but then the whole premise of "eliciting from base model" changes.

> what kind of simple baseline scheme could you run with a base moedl where you extract the logprob of each task, and then focus on the uncertain ones 

⏺ Here are practical schemes - all O(N) and simple to implement:

  ---
  Scheme 1: Confidence Threshold Bootstrap

  Cost: O(N)

  Step 1: Label all N examples, extract logprobs
     For each example:
     - P_true = P(True | context)
     - P_false = P(False | context)
     - confidence = max(P_true, P_false)
     - predicted_label = argmax

  Step 2: Split by confidence
     High confidence (conf > 0.8): ~60% of data
     Medium confidence (0.6 < conf < 0.8): ~30%
     Low confidence (conf < 0.6): ~10%

  Step 3: Bootstrap strategy
     - Train RM₁ on high-confidence examples only
     - Use RM₁ to label medium+low confidence examples
     - Train RM₂ (final) on all N examples

  Key: Only pay O(N³) ICM cost on the 10% uncertain subset, or skip ICM entirely.

  ---
  Scheme 2: Logprob Margin-Based Selection

  Cost: O(N)

  Step 1: Compute margin for each example
     margin = |P(True) - P(False)|

     High margin (>0.6): model is confident
     Low margin (<0.2): model is confused

  Step 2: Handle by margin
     High margin: keep predicted label
     Low margin:
        Option A: Discard (train on high-margin only)
        Option B: Sample 5x at temp=1, take majority
        Option C: Get human label
        Option D: Use stronger model

  Step 3: Train RM on resulting labels

  Intuition: Margin = confidence. Focus expensive methods on low-margin cases.

  Scheme 3: Uncertainty-Weighted Training

  Cost: O(N)

  Step 1: Label all N, compute confidence per example
     confidence_i = max(P_true, P_false)

  Step 2: Train RM with sample weights
     weight_i = confidence_i^α  (e.g., α=2)
     
     High confidence examples: high weight
     Low confidence: low weight (model downweights uncertain labels)

  Step 3: Optionally iterate
     - Use RM to relabel low-confidence examples
     - Retrain

  Key: Don't discard uncertain examples, just downweight them during training.

  ---
  Scheme 4: Two-Stage with Model Cascade

  Cost: O(N) + O(k·N) where k < 0.2

  Step 1: Base model labels all N
     Extract confidence via logprobs

  Step 2: For bottom k% (say k=20%, lowest confidence):
     Option A: Self-consistency (sample 5x, majority vote)
     Option B: Use different model (slightly larger)
     Option C: Use few-shot with confident examples as context
     Option D: Human annotation

  Step 3: Train RM on combined labels
     - 80% from cheap base model
     - 20% from expensive method

  Budget-aware: Most examples get cheap labeling, uncertain ones get more compute.

  ---
  Scheme 5: Entropy-Based Active Selection

  Cost: O(N)

  Step 1: For each example, compute entropy
     H = -P(True)·log P(True) - P(False)·log P(False)

     Low H: confident
     High H (~0.69 for binary): maximally uncertain

  Step 2: Sort by entropy, split dataset
     Bottom 50% (low H): keep labels
     Top 50% (high H): apply better labeling

  Step 3: Train on combined set

  Advantage: Entropy is principled measure of uncertainty.

  ---
  Scheme 6: Calibrated Threshold Search

  Cost: O(N) + small validation set

  Step 1: Label all N, extract logprobs

  Step 2: If you have small validation set (say 100 examples with gold labels):
     - Try different confidence thresholds τ
     - For each τ, keep examples with confidence > τ
     - Train RM, evaluate on validation
     - Pick best τ

  Step 3: Use that threshold on full dataset

  Data-driven threshold selection (but requires small labeled validation set).

  ---
  Scheme 7: Logprob + Self-Consistency Hybrid

  Cost: O(N) for most, O(5N) for uncertain

  Step 1: Zero-shot all N examples at temp=0
     Extract logprobs, compute confidence

  Step 2: For confident examples (conf > 0.8): keep label

  Step 3: For uncertain (conf < 0.8):
     - Sample 5 times at temp=1.0
     - If ≥4/5 agree: use majority label
     - If 3/5 split: still uncertain → maybe discard

  Step 4: Train RM on resulting subset

  Adaptive compute: Simple cases get 1 forward pass, hard cases get 5.

  ---
  Scheme 8: Contrast with Negation

  Cost: O(N) or O(2N)

  For each example:
  Step 1: Compute P(True | input)
  Step 2: Compute P(False | input)  [or P(not True | input)]

  Step 3: Check calibration
     If P(True) + P(False) ≈ 1 → well-calibrated, confident
     If P(True) + P(False) << 1 → model putting mass elsewhere, uncertain

  Step 4: Keep only well-calibrated predictions

  Tests if model is using probability mass properly.

  ---
  My Recommendation: Start with Scheme 1 (Simplest)

  # Pseudocode
  labels = []
  confidences = []

  # Step 1: Label everything
  for example in dataset:
      logits = base_model(example)
      p_true = softmax(logits)["True"]
      p_false = softmax(logits)["False"]

      confidence = max(p_true, p_false)
      label = "True" if p_true > p_false else "False"

      labels.append(label)
      confidences.append(confidence)

  # Step 2: Filter by confidence
  threshold = 0.8
  high_conf_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(confidences) if c > threshold]
  high_conf_data = dataset[high_conf_indices]
  high_conf_labels = labels[high_conf_indices]

  # Step 3: Train RM on high-confidence subset
  RM = train_reward_model(high_conf_data, high_conf_labels)

  # Step 4: Use RM to label everything
  all_labels = RM.predict(dataset)

  # Step 5: Train final RM
  RM_final = train_reward_model(dataset, all_labels)

  Why This Beats ICM as Baseline:

  | Property                  | Logprob Confidence | ICM                       |
  |---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
  | Cost                      | O(N)               | O(N³) or O(N⁴)            |
  | Leverages model knowledge | ✓ (probabilities)  | ✓ (mutual predictability) |
  | Requires other examples   | ✗                  | ✓ (all N-1)               |
  | Simple to implement       | ✓                  | ✗                         |
  | Interpretable             | ✓                  | ✗                         |
  | Scalable                  | ✓                  | ✗                         |

  If ICM can't significantly beat this simple baseline, its complexity isn't justified!

⏺ Scheme 1: Confidence Threshold Bootstrap

  Simple version (temp=0, no resampling):

  ---
  Step 1: Label everything with confidence scores
  - Run base model on all N examples (temp=0)
  - For each example, extract:
    - P(True) and P(False) from logits
    - Predicted label = argmax
    - Confidence = max(P(True), P(False))

  Step 2: Keep only high-confidence labels
  - Set threshold τ = 0.8 (or 0.7, tune if you have small val set)
  - Filter to examples where confidence > τ
  - This gives you ~6K high-confidence labeled examples

  Step 3: Bootstrap to full dataset
  - Train RM₁ on those 6K high-confidence examples
  - Use RM₁ to label all 400K examples
  - Train RM₂ (final) on all 400K

  ---
  That's it. O(N) cost, no sampling, no resampling.

  Comparison to ICM:
  - Same bootstrap structure (small labeled set → RM → full dataset)
  - But initialization is trivial (logprobs) instead of O(N³) ICM
  - Tests whether ICM's complexity buys you anything over simple confidence filtering

> for now im just focused on comparing accuracy of schemes. so not about reward models. 

⏺ Scheme 1: Confidence-Based Filtering

  For comparing label accuracy only:

  ---
  Step 1: Label all N examples
  - Run base model (temp=0)
  - Extract P(True), P(False)
  - Predicted label = argmax
  - Confidence = max(P(True), P(False))

  Step 2: Filter by confidence threshold
  - Keep only examples where confidence > τ (e.g., τ = 0.8)
  - This gives you a subset of ~60-80% of data

  Step 3: Evaluate accuracy
  - Compare filtered labels against gold labels
  - Report: accuracy on the subset you kept

  ---
  Comparison metric:

  For different methods, report:
  - Coverage: % of data labeled
  - Accuracy: % correct among labeled examples

  Example:
  | Method          | Coverage | Accuracy |
  |-----------------|----------|----------|
  | ICM (6K)        | 2.3%     | 85%      |
  | Logprob (τ=0.8) | 60%      | 82%      |
  | Logprob (τ=0.9) | 40%      | 88%      |

  Key question: Does ICM give better accuracy than just "keep high-confidence predictions"?

> look at the ablation experiment. I think it is good that they ran this but it is insufficnetly baselined. They only try random modifications of labels, but in practice the labels that are wrong might be the hardest ones. In any case i want to run experiments with the same measurement, but somwhow 
"adjusting for accuracy of the labelling". Basically i want to try different baselines, see what accuracy they get, and then plot that against the resulting accuracy with many-shot prompting like in fig 8. Does that make sense? how exactly would you do this. be very concise 

⏺ Yes, makes sense. Here's how:

  Procedure:

  1. Generate labels from different methods:
    - ICM
    - Logprob filtering (vary threshold to get different accuracies)
    - Zero-shot
    - Self-consistency (if you must, but you said temp=0)
    - Random perturbations (their baseline)
  2. For each method:
    - Measure label accuracy vs gold labels
    - Use those labels for many-shot prompting on test set
    - Measure test accuracy
  3. Plot:
    - X-axis: Label accuracy (% correct)
    - Y-axis: Test accuracy after many-shot prompting
    - One point per method/configuration

  What this shows:
  Whether ICM's labels are "better quality" than other methods at the same accuracy level - i.e., does the line for ICM sit above other baselines?

  Example result:
  - Random 80% labels → 70% test accuracy
  - Logprob 80% labels → 72% test accuracy
  - ICM 80% labels → 73% test accuracy
  - Suggests ICM errors are more "learnable"
